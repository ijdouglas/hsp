// <p align="left"><b>INFORMED CONSENT STATEMENT</b></p>
// <p align="left"><b>Multimodal Word Learning â€“ Cross-Situational Learning in Adults</b></p>
// <p align="left">You are invited to participate in a research study of language learning. We are interested
// in how people learn words and categories. We are mainly concerned with how humans
// learn to associate words with referents. We are not interested in the particular behaviors
// of particular individuals.</p>

// <p align="left"><b>INFORMATION</b></p>

// <p align="left">The entire study will last 20 minutes. You will be asked to study some videos/pictures
// while listening to some sounds/words. You may be asked to learn which sound/word
// goes with which referent in the visual stimuli. During or after this experiment, your
// performance will be automatically collected. These data help us assess learning over the
// course of the experiment.</p>

// <p align="left"><b>RISKS</b></p>

// <p align="left">There is potential risk of loss of confidentiality. This risk is minimized by the investigator,
// as outlined in the confidentiality section.</p>

// <p align="left"><b>BENEFITS</b></p>

// <p align="left">There are no direct benefits to the subjects. However, the findings will give us more
// information about how people link words to object categories.</p>

// <p align="left"><b>NUMBER OF PEOPLE TAKING PART IN THE STUDY</b></p>

// <p align="left">If you agree to participate, you will be one of approximately 1,500 people who will be
// participating in this research study.</p>

// <p align="left"><b>CONFIDENTIALITY</b></p>

// <p align="left">Your identity will be held in confidence in reports in which the study may be
// published. The digital record and data will be saved on a password-protected computer
// in a locked laboratory. The data collected from you will be made available only to
// trained experimenters conducting the study and specific organizations that may inspect
// or copy research data for quality assurance, such as the IU Institutional Review Board or
// its designees or the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).
// Digital records will be kept indefinitely as endorsed by the National Institutes of
// Health. Data, with no links to your identity, will be kept indefinitely. If for any reason you
// decide to withdraw from the study, either while in progress or after completing the
// procedure, digital records of you will be destroyed.</p>

// <p align="left">For the protection of your privacy, this research is covered by a Certificate of
// Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health. The researchers may not disclose
// or use any information, documents, or specimens that could identify you in any civil,
// criminal, administrative, legislative, or other legal proceeding, unless you consent to it.
// Information, documents, or specimens protected by this Certificate may be disclosed to
// someone who is not connected with the research:</p>

// <p align="left">(1) If there is a federal, state, or local law that requires disclosure (such as to
// report child abuse or communicable diseases);</p>
// <p align="left">(2) if it is used for other scientific research in a way that is allowed by the federal
// regulations that protect research subjects</p>
// <p align="left">(3) for the purpose of auditing or program evaluation by the government or
// funding agency</p>

// <p align="left">You should understand that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you from
// voluntarily releasing information about yourself. If you want your research information
// released to an insurer, medical care provider, or any other person not connected with
// the research, you must provide consent to allow the researchers to release it.</p>

// <p align="left"><b>FUTURE USE</b></p>
